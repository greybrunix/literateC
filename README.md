# literateC

**literateC** is a UNIX LR(1) parser for C89 literate Programming.

### Note
  **literateC** is not a compiler or a typesetting program,
it is just a translation parser to C and (La)TeX

## Features

  * It produces a temporary LaTeX file with a one to one translation of
the source .ltc code;
  * It produces a temporary C file with necessary changes in
order to be compilable in C89;
  * By default it compiles the C code and produces a .dvi, .ps
or a .pdf file.
  * The temporary files are, by default, preserved but can be
optioned to not be stored, being deleted upon termination.
